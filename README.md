3) Set up the PostgreSql database. Make sure you have a running PostgreSql server, and create a new database or use an existing one for SearchWork. Import the necessary SQL queries from the sql folder to create the required tables and populate them with data.
4) Configure the database connection. Update the database connection settings in the application's configuration file to match your PostgreSql database. The configuration file can typically be found in the app.config or web.config file.
